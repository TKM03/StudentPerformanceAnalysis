# 📊 Student Performance Analysis in an Entrance Examination

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance in an entrance examination using various factors such as academic scores, socioeconomic background, and coaching influence. The goal is to gain insights into key predictors of performance and apply statistical modeling for analysis.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Class X & XII Performance**: Academic scores categorized as Excellent, Very Good, Good, or Average.
- **Gender**: Student gender information.
- **Coaching Influence**: Whether a student attended coaching classes.
- **Parental Occupation**: Father's and Mother's occupations.
- **Medium of Instruction**: Language of study.
- **Socioeconomic Indicators**: Additional background information.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **R** (Data Processing, Statistical Modeling, and Visualization)
- **tidyverse** (Data Wrangling)
- **summarytools** (Data Summarization)
- **corrplot** (Correlation Visualization)
- **ggplot2** (Data Visualization)
- **MASS** (Ordinal Regression Modeling)

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps
### 🏗 Data Cleaning
- Categorical variables converted to factors.
- Academic performance levels transformed into numerical values for analysis.
- Missing values handled appropriately.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of performance levels analyzed.
- Influence of gender and coaching on performance.
- Correlation analysis between numerical variables.

### 📈 Statistical Modeling
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts performance based on academic scores and coaching influence.
- **Ordinal Logistic Regression**: Evaluates categorical performance levels.

### 🎓 Socioeconomic Influence
- Analyzing the impact of parental occupation on student performance.
- Visualization of performance trends across different socioeconomic groups.
